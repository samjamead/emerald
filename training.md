# Training

When we’re under the day to day pressure of work, it’s easy to lose sight of what we are trying to achieve and especially the simple disciplines and actions that help make businesses successful and a great environment to be a part of.

Saying or doing the right thing at the right time can make all the difference to that environment and to the success of that business.

And of course, effective training is essential in introducing and consolidating those skills to teams and colleagues too. It’s a core part of successful personal and business growth and development.

## Training Courses
I offer courses where conversation is key such as Presentation Skills, Negotiation Skills, Giving and Receiving Feedback, and Having Challenging Conversations.

Some course summaries are shown below and I’ll be introducing a series of new courses and sessions in the New Year to support Managers and Leaders in their roles.

(As an ex Advertising Agency Production Director, I run a mean session on the dark art of CMYK too!)

### Presentation Skills
A one-day course for a maximum of 6 delegates that introduces the core elements of delivering impactful and, most importantly, successful presentations. It’s especially beneficial to people who are relatively new to designing and delivering Presentations and need to overcome their doubts and relax into their own style of delivery.

### Negotiation Skills
The best negotiators know the factors that will give them the very best chances of securing the outcome they want. It’s all about knowing what to say, when and why - and sometimes when to not say anything at all! A half day session.

### Print Production and the dark art of CMYK
When a printer produces a newspaper, a leaflet or maybe some packaging, people are amazed to discover that it’s nearly always printed using just 4 colours, and one of those is black! So how do they do that? And how can you ensure the printer you give the printer the best brief to achieve the best results? A half-day session.
