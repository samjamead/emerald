# Training

Richard Branson famously said:

> “Train people well enough so they can leave. Treat them well enough so they don't want to.”

The CMI\* report that a whopping 50% of workers are planning to resign in the next year, citing a toxic environment created by a poor manager.

They also observe that more than 80% of UK managers now fall under the category of ‘accidental manager’; those who didn’t necessarily set out for leadership but have found themselves in a position of managing people yet, in too many cases, without the necessary training and support.

Branson wouldn’t approve!

My training courses share the skills and build the confidence managers at all levels need to transform into active, supportive, and assured managers and leaders; managers who have what it takes to build workplace environments that empower teams to truly succeed.

> “We have big ambitions to create a training centre of excellence at We Are Futures.
> Partnering with Alan, from an initial small coaching and coaching workshops programme in 2022, to a full, Agency-wide Management & Leadership training programme in 2023 has been a key part of delivering on that promise.
> And Alan’s calm, clear and charming approach consistently generates positive feedback from all levels of the Agency”.

## The Confident Manager

Confident managers aren’t afraid to have the difficult conversations needed to tackle small issues before they become big problems. They build positive work environments that are shaped by the needs of their team. And they adapt their communication styles to connect with each individual.

The Confident Manager training programme transforms hesitant, apprehensive, uncertain managers into skilled, effective, assured managers and leaders. Whether they’re new to the world of management, or would benefit from a skills refresh.

A full course description is available [here](/downloads/theConfidentManager.pdf), with FAQs answered [here](/downloads/theConfidentManagerFAQ.pdf).

This is a brand new course, presented at the state of the art, accessible Node CoWork building at Roundswell in Barnstaple, structured in three, 3 hour sessions that could also easily be adapted to meet specific Clients’ needs.

## Managing Performance

A half day that explores the often difficult conversations that all Managers need to have when it comes to the ongoing management of their teams, both day to day and in ongoing reviews.

The session explains Coaching for Performance using the superb GROW model, how to manage difficult conversations using actual scenarios to allow delegates to practice “teeing up” these discussions, and looking at the different types of conflict managers experience in the workplace.

## Introduction to Presentation Skills

A full day session for just 6 delegates that explores structuring, designing and confidently delivering effective presentations. We look closely at understanding your audience, keeping their engagement, and dealing with questions from the audience.

In the afternoon, all delegates will be able to deliver an existing presentation of their own, applying all the techniques they have learned during the morning.

## Managing People Through Change

Change is a law of life. It happens when we least expect it. And almost inevitably, it’s disruptive, whether it’s at home or at work. And it can be overwhelming too.

At work, when changes happen, the team will look to their Manager for guidance.

If Managers and Leaders understand how we all think and how change unfolds, they can better understand how we all respond to change and how they can therefore better manage their teams through whatever change is thrown at them.

## Presentation Skills

A one-day course for a maximum of 6 delegates that introduces the core elements of delivering impactful and, most importantly, successful presentations. It’s especially beneficial to people who are relatively new to designing and delivering Presentations and need to overcome their doubts and relax into their own style of delivery.

## Print Production and the dark art of CMYK

When a printer produces a newspaper, a leaflet or maybe some packaging, people are amazed to discover that it’s nearly always printed using just 4 colours, and one of those is black! So how do they do that? And how can you ensure the printer you give the printer the best brief to achieve the best results? A half-day session.
