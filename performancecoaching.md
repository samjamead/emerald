# Performance and Executive Coaching

I have served on two company Boards and acquired many years’ management experience in a career that spans over 30 years.

I’m certified as a Coach by The Coaching Organisation and I’m a member of both the Association for Coaching and the CIPD.

My experience embraces coaching at all levels, from new starters and first-time managers through to Executive Coaching at Board level.

>Alan is a skilled listener who helped me unpick my challenges one by one. He very adeptly helped me to work through, prioritise and plan actions around both personal and professional dilemmas in a way which left me empowered, excited and inspired.  An impressive result and a skill which offers enormous value.

I help my Clients to be better in what they do, be that running and managing businesses and teams, pushing for promotion, or simply getting to grips with a challenging new role.

For me, the key to success is helping my Clients to identify for themselves the specific actions they can take to help them make progress and achieve their goals.

Because when any of us create our own solutions, we own them and we’re far more likely to act on them. It’s so much better than simply being told what to do!

>One of my team was going through a challenging period at work. Alan’s easy-going manner allowed her to open up without any barriers - she has come out of the sessions with a clear sense of purpose and a renewed confidence and energy.

We all want to be better at what we do in our professional lives. And we all have goals and objectives intended to achieve those improvements.

But in business, as in our daily lives, we can get blocked, lose our way or just get so wrapped up in the day to day that we lose sight of what we really want to achieve. Or indeed are expected to achieve.

### Performance Coaching

Performance Coaching focuses on exactly that – improving your performance. You might be making your first moves into management, feeling “stuck” in your current career or role, maybe pushing hard for that promotion that always seems out of reach.

Performance Coaching will help you to identify and focus on the key factors that influence how you can improve your performance and achieve your goals.

### Executive Coaching

Executive Coaching is all about enhancing your leadership or management performance and development. It’s as relevant for the first time entrepreneur and small business owner as it is for
an experienced corporate professional.

Executive Coaching embraces myriad different areas – communication, how you perceive yourself and those around you, and how others perceive you, the impact of this on your management and leadership style. It might be about improving relationships within your business, leveraging your strengths, or perhaps addressing the areas you want to grow stronger in.

I will work with you and challenge you to achieve what you want and support you on that journey.

### How I work with my Performance and Executive Coaching Clients

A typical Coaching programme comprises a series for between 4 and 6 sessions, each approximately 90 minutes long. Ideally, these would be face to face but there is the option of talking over the phone or via Skype.

We would meet every two weeks or so to start with then schedule the later sessions with longer intervals as we progress. All our conversations will be in the strictest confidence and
I’ll also be available on the phone and via e mail between sessions.

But before I ask you to commit to anything, we will arrange to meet or have a telephone conversation to talk about what you want to achieve and to allow you to get to know a bit more about me. It’s important that we’re clear about the objectives for our sessions and also that you feel confident that we’re going to get on!

If your Coaching is being sponsored by your line manager or a more senior member of your business, it’s important that we all agree in advance what the Coaching needs to focus on. This is know as Three Way Contracting and can be done by email, a conference call or face to face before the Coaching starts.

To find out more about how we might work together, and how we could tailor a programme to meet your specific needs, please get in touch with me below.

I’d be happy to answer any questions you might have.
