    <h1>Hi – I’m Alan. I’m a qualified Coach and an experienced Trainer.</h1>

    <p>I believe we are all capable of so much more. Wherever we want to thrive and really achieve our dreams and ambitions. At work and at home.</p>

    <p>But it’s easy to get blocked and lose our way, then spend too much time looking elsewhere for the answers that are actually already within us.</p>

      Alan came into my life when it started to change. With his coaching I felt empowered to take the reins and develop a sense of control. With his help, I found I was able to take a breath and look objectively at decisions I had to make. And then I found I was able to breathe on my own.

    <p><a href={{ "/coaching" | prepend: site.url }}>Coaching</a> helps you to get closer to those answers and achieve things you might previously have not thought possible. It helps you to unlock your potential.</p>

    <p>I work with individuals and businesses to help people realise their potential by helping them to work out the answers to those challenging questions and issues.</p>

    <p>My <a href={{ "/coachingworkshops" | prepend: site.url }}>Coaching Workshops</a> introduce the powerful benefits of coaching to managers at all levels to help them to better engage with, and empower, their teams and colleagues.</p>

    <p><a href={{ "/performancecoaching" | prepend: site.url }}>Performance and Executive Coaching</a> is all about achieving goals. I help people across all levels of business to grow, develop and improve in their role, from the first-time manager to the experienced executive.</p>

    <p>As well as Coaching, I’ve been designing and delivering <a href={{ "/training" | prepend: site.url }}>Training</a> since 2012. My training focuses on helping people have better conversations. Coaching plays an important part in my training too as it doesn’t have to be a one-to-one experience.</p>
