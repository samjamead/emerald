# Personal Coaching

Do you want to make positive changes in your life? What would you really like to achieve?! Are you feeling stuck and not sure how to move forward?

We all face difficult challenges and problems. Whether making tricky decisions, getting “unstuck”, considering career change, your own personal development, or maybe striking a better work life balance – the challenges we all face and the obstacles we place in our own way can be daunting.

I can help you to navigate your way through those issues, find the answers you’re looking for and make plans for positive change.

I do this by creating the time and space for you to talk and for me to listen carefully to what you have to say then asking helpful and thought-provoking questions. This will help you to better understand what might be stopping you moving forward, then I can help you to put a plan in place to make positive changes in your life.

We often find ourselves confronted by challenges that can seem unsurmountable.  Or it could be a feeling of simply being overwhelmed by everything that’s happening in our lives.

It’s as though you don’t know which way to turn.

As your coach, I can help you better understand what might be holding you back in some way, or get greater clarity about what might be troubling you. Then we can work together to start making the plans and positive changes that will let you move forward with your life.

You might want to talk about problems that you need to tackle, getting more focused in what you do, getting unstuck or breaking out of old, established habits that might be holding you back, or simply looking to feel happier.

This could be in any number of areas too, perhaps improving your work-life balance, your career development, your personal development, or time management and juggling the numerous responsibilities in your life.

### How I work with my Personal Coaching Clients

A typical Coaching session lasts approximately 90 minutes or so. Ideally, it happens face to face but we can talk over the phone or by Skype if necessary too.

We would usually commit to at least 3 sessions and often 6 sessions, every two weeks to start with then with longer intervals as we progress. All our conversations will be in the strictest confidence

I’ll be available on the phone and via email between sessions too.

But before I ask you to commit to anything, we will arrange a telephone conversation to talk about what you want to achieve and to allow you to get to know a bit more about me. It’s important that you feel confident that we’re going to get on!

So to find out more about how we might work together, please get in touch with me below. I look forward to hearing from you.
