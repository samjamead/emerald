    <h1>Hi – I’m Alan. I’m a qualified Coach and an experienced Trainer.</h1>

    <p>I believe we are all capable of so much more. Wherever we want to thrive and really achieve our dreams and ambitions. At work and at home.</p>

    <p>But it’s easy to get blocked and lose our way, then spend too much time looking elsewhere for the answers that are actually already within us.</p>

    <blockquote class="copy-quote">
      <img class="opening-speechmarks" src="./assets/images/speechmarks.png" alt="speechmarks" />
      Alan came into my life when it started to change. With his coaching I felt empowered to take the reins and develop a sense of control. With his help, I found I was able to take a breath and look objectively at decisions I had to make. And then I found I was able to breathe on my own.

    <p><a href="#coaching" class="smooth-scroll">Coaching</a> helps you to get closer to those answers and achieve things you might previously have not thought possible. It helps you to unlock your potential.</p>

    <p>I work with individuals and businesses to help people realise their potential by helping them to work out the answers to those challenging questions and issues.</p>

    <p>My <a href="#" class="smooth-scroll">Coaching Workshops</a> introduce the powerful benefits of coaching to managers at all levels to help them to better engage with, and empower, their teams and colleagues.</p>

    <p>Paragraph about <a href="#" class="smooth-scroll">Performance and Executive Coaching</a> lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

    <p>As well as Coaching, I’ve been designing and delivering <a href="#training" class="smooth-scroll">Training</a> since 2012. My training focuses on helping people have better conversations. Coaching plays an important part in my training too as it doesn’t have to be a one-to-one experience.</p>

    <p>The Coaching could be focused on issues and challenges in your personal life.</p>

    <p>Or it could be about a work issue affecting you or one of your colleagues. In a work context, I’m experienced working at all levels, from new starters through to Executive Coaching at Board level.<p>

    <p>Either way, it’s made up of a series of one to one sessions, ideally face to face and typically around 90 minutes long. Usually, we would agree the specific topic you want to discuss in these sessions in advance and we would always have an initial chat first before you commit to any formal arrangements, just to see how we get on!</p>

          Helen was going through a challenging period at work. Alan’s easy-going manner allowed her to open up without any barriers - she has come out of the sessions with a clear sense of purpose and a renewed confidence and energy.

          Alan's training has quote about not being told what to do and automatically resisting it, but owning the solution and wanting to make it happen. Would recommend to a friend.
